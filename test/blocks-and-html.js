Textile has a problem with blocks when mixed with HTML.

What it does, traditionally, is to split everything up by "\n\n" and consider
each of the items as a block. If the block starts with a known block handler
syntax, then it gets converted accordingly.

HTML blocks are parsed as blocks if they start with one of the allowed HTML block
tags. Inside the block, as normal, block level tags are not parsed but phrases are.
No automatic-linebreaking happens inside HTML.

All of this leads to a bunch of interesting complications.

For this textile:

```
<div>
p. This is a block.
</div>
```

One might expect either one of the following treatments:

```
<div>
<p>This is a block.</p>
</div>
```

Or:

```
<div>A<br />
p. This is a block.<br />
A</div>
```

But in fact, the whole thing is a "HTML block", and is
handled specifically as such: Phrase level things are parsed,
but not linebroken:

```
<div>
p. This is *a block*.
With two lines.
</div>
```

*/

test('Block level markup is not parsed inside HTML', t => {
  const tx = `<div>
p. This is *a block*.
With two lines.
</div>`;
  const op = `<div>
p. This is <strong>a block</strong>.
With two lines.
</div>`;
  t.is(textile.convert(tx), op, tx); t.end();
});

/*

Of course, this means that \n\n inside a HTML structure will cause havoc:

```
<div>
p. This is *a block*.

With two lines.
</div>
````

```
<p><div><br />
p. This is <strong>a block</strong>.</p>

<p>With two lines.<br />
</div></p>
```

A user is supped to be able to escape the textile linebreaking with spaces, but
has limited usefulness:

```
 <div>
p. This is *a block*.

With two lines.
 </div>
```

```
<p><div><br />
p. This is <strong>a block</strong>.</p>

<p>With two lines.
 </div></p>
```

Because, it only works "sometimes":

```
 <div>

p. This is *a block*.

 </div>
```

```
<p><div></p>

<p>This is <strong>a block</strong>.</p>

 </div>
```

Textile-JS disregards all of these and treats HTML blocks with
the HTML parsing rules regarless of any leading spaces.
